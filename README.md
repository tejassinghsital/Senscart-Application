# Senscart-Application
This is the main codebase for our startup Senscart

Update(10-04-2022):
It's back online means the work on this idea is again started after quite sometime because of lack of experience and several unwanted situations like domain expiry due to overpriced charges etc. But now i have learned MERN stack so back on track with this project hopefully it extend to a point where it can help others.
